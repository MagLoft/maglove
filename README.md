[MagLove](http://bitbucket.org/magloft/maglove/) - MagLoft Theme Toolkit
==================================================


What is it?
-----------

MagLove is a prepared environment to create themes, widgets and templates for MagLoft's powerful Editor.

What you need to create your own themes
---------------------------------------

In order to use TypeLoft TDK, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

For Windows you have to download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Mac OS users should install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.


Installation
------------

Install the MagLove gem:

```bash
gem install maglove
```

Theme Development
-----------------

To develop a new theme, look inside src/themes/one/ for a reference. You can also copy this directory to create a new theme based on the 'one' theme.
